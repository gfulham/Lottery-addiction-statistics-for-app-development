    "one_ticket_probability() to calculate the probability of winning the jackpot with a single ticket\n",
    "check_historical_occurrence() to checks if a certain combination has occurred before in the dataset\n",

    "small_prize_probability() to calculate the probability of having a two, three, four or five winning number match\n",
    "If we wanted to continue building more features into our app, some next steps could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the outputs even easier for the user to understand by adding memorable analogies of strange events that occur in life at similar probabilities.\n",
    "Combine the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() functions to output probability and historical occurrence information at the same time.\n",
    "Create another function similar to small_prize_probability(), but one that calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four, or five winning numbers instead of the quantity entered exactly.\n",
